I'm a design-minded software engineer based in Boston, Massachusetts. I specialize in developing (and occasionally designing) beautiful, high-quality websites and web applications.

Currently, I'm an Engineer at [Upstatement](https://www.upstatement.com/) working on some exciting projects with some amazing people.

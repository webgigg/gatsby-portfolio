Final project for my Database Design course at Northeastern. A simple web application that allows users to filter through a database containing Lonely Planet's [Top 500 Travel Destinations](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planets-Ultimate-Travel-Places/dp/1760342777). Users are able to add themselves as visitors as well as leave reviews of the destinations.

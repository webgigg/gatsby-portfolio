A web app that allows people to crowdsource a party's music queue via their smartphones. The web app allows people to see the currently playing song, request songs, upvote songs, and rate songs so the DJ can see how the crowd is feeling and act accordingly. Won Best UI/UX Design at Hackbeanpot 2017.

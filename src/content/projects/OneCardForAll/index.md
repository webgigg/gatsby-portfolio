MullenLowe's 2015 holiday site built around an algorithm that generated a holiday greeting to each and every person on the planet. As new names appeared, visitors could watch them fall like snowflakes, onto a stylized world map. Users could also find their own name and see it as part of the world collective. Check out this short [video](https://us.mullenlowe.com/work/one-card-for-all/) describing the project.
